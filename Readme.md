This browser extension allows you to do enhance Arxiv with 4 features:

1. 📄 **Go back to an arxiv-hosted pdf to its abstract page**. For instance: from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06907.pdf to https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06907 in a couple of clicks.
2. 🗂 **Add a direct download button** so that you don't have to open the pdf's webpage and then download it from your browser
3. 🔗**Add a Markdown link**, because it's the little things that make sharing a paper easier (to be used in issues, PRs, Readme etc.)
4. 🎫**Add the paper's BibTex citation directly on its abstract webpage**, because citing papers should not be a hassle, the extension directly queries and parses Arxiv's API.
5. 🎬 **Change a pdf's webpage title to the article's title**, because who cares about that saved bookmark `1812.10889.pdf` when it could be `InstaGAN: Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation (1812.10889).pdf`
